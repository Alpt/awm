* If inside the current X there's just one Y and you delete it, then 
  the current X will be deleted too.

* New feature: the terminals opened in new workspaces are
  preemptive. Awm keeps one terminal already launched, so when you move on
  a new workspace it just unhides the terminal window and launches another 
  hidden terminal. This gives a great speed gain.

* Using  "exec xsetroot -mod 0 0" instead of "exec xsetbg /.../black"

* Some bugs fixed.

- 0.0.6

* You can insert a new X (Y) between two consecutive Xs (Ys).
  For example, if you are in Y2 and there's already Y3, by pressing 
  Ctrl+Alt+Return, a new Y between Y2 and Y3 is created.
  The same is for the X with Alt+Shift+Return.

* bug of TileOnTheFly fixed

Committed revision 1231.

* Tiling on the fly:
  The windows can be ordered on the fly with the tiling algorithm of dwm,
  and then restored. This is useful to get a quick glimpse of the current
  workspace.
  
  By pressing (right)Crtl+(left)Alt+Tab all the windows of the current Y are ordered
  with the tiling algorithm of dwm. Re-pressing (right)Crtl+(left)Alt+Tab, the
  windows will be restored to their pre-tile configuration.
  This feature is useful to get a quick glimpse of the current Y.
